Jacobs</a>. Throughout my career, I have tackled problems in detection, 3D reconstruction, registration, and natural language processing. I am passionate about geometric computer vision, NLP, and deep learning. My work has included 3D facial reconstruction, depth estimation, 2D computer vision, and Natural Language Processing. At NIO, I led part of the digital cockpit team to develop and deploy sentry mode in production and patented the algorithms. More recently, I have been working on personal preojects found on github.
