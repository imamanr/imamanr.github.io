    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
        I'm Imama Ali, a computer engineer/scientist with 10 years of industry experience, specializing in Multi-modal(text, audio, images, and video) machine learning models, 2D/3D computer vision, and machine learning. I completed my PhD at the <a href="https://www.memphis.edu/eece/">University of Memphis</a>(2009-2013) under the supervision of <a href="https://umwa.memphis.edu/fcv/viewprofile.php?uuid=eljacobs">Dr. Eddie L. Jacobs</a>. Throughout my career, I have tackled problems in detection, 3D reconstruction, depth estimation, registration, and natural language processing. Notably, my work includes projects like 3D facial reconstruction from single image, Monocular depth estimation, 2D/3D object detection, segmentation, multi-view camera 3D scan pipeline and application development based on multi-modal large language models. At NIO, I led efforts to develop and deploy sentry mode in production and patented the algorithms. In my most recent position as an R&D Scientist, I led the design, development, and integration of advanced autonomous systems for aerial and maritime platforms operating in contested environments. I spearheaded multi-agent collaboration autonomy, passive vision-based navigation, and multi-modal intent recognition using state-of-the-art deep learning and foundation models.
