    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
        I'm Imama Ali, a computer engineer/scientist with 10 years of industry experience, specializing in Multi-modal(text, audio, images, and video) machine learning models, 2D/3D computer vision, and machine learning. I completed my PhD at the <a href="https://www.memphis.edu/eece/">University of Memphis</a>(2009-2013) under the supervision of <a href="https://umwa.memphis.edu/fcv/viewprofile.php?uuid=eljacobs">Dr. Eddie L. Jacobs</a>. Throughout my career, I have tackled problems in detection, 3D reconstruction, depth estimation, registration, and natural language processing. I am passionate about geometric computer vision, NLP, and deep learning. Notably, my work includes projects like 3D facial reconstruction from single image, Monocular depth estimation, 2D/3D object detection, segmentation, multi-view camera 3D scan pipeline and application development based on multi-modal large language models. At NIO, I led efforts to develop and deploy sentry mode in production and patented the algorithms. Recently, I have been engaged in personal projects available on github such as lip sync based on text, audio, and image modalities. In addition designing and building evaluation frameworks and metrics for LLM/LVM-based applications. My goal is to lead teams towards achieving business objectives and pushing technological boundaries.
